    <p>
      The Chronicles of Narnia is written by
      <a href="http://www.cslewis.com/us/" target="_blank">C. S. Lewis</a> and
      illustrated by
      <a href="https://www.paulinebaynes.com/" target="_blank">Pauline Baynes</a
      >. The story begins with four siblings who find themselves in a magical
      world filled with magical creatures. I would continue, but I don't want to
      give any spoilers!
